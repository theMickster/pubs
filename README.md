# Pubs Web App 

We're taking it back WAY old school for this sample application with the Microsoft pubs sample database circa 2000. 
The project contains a variety of samples that showcase a variety of techniques for building web applications built upon ASP.NET Core in .NET 5 and Angular that utilize SQL Server as the storage mechanism. 

For folks not as old as me, the Pubs database provides a set of fictional pieces of information about publishers, authors, titles and sales of books.

## Framework & Technologies used
The sample application utilizes the following technologies
* [Angular](https://angular.io/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [.NET 5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
